Given a mockup and other resources to develop a simple sigle page appthat allow users to register and view other users using React:

1. an API was consumed using GET mehtod to display 5 users per page.
2. On click the "Show more" button, the user data is loaded with subsequent page data e.g. page 1 to page 2 data and so on. When the last page is reached, the button is hidden.
3. an API was consumed using GET method to populate the radio buttons with available positions.
4. an API was consumed using POST method to register new users with required form validations managed

5. Optimization was carried as images were minimized, fonts files were added into the root folder and other required optimization tehcniques employed to ensure that the application meets minimum standards on Google Page Speed and Google Chrome Performance Audit / Lighthouse.
